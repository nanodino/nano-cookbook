Roasted Potatoes in Lemon Parsley Sauce 🌿🍃
RECIPE 👉🏼
🌟INGREDIENTS 🌟:- 
6 medium potatoes, peeled
Oil, salt and pepper for roasting
1 tbsp oil
1/4 cup onion (very finely chopped)
3/4 cup white wine (or broth)
1/2 tsp dried tarragon
1 tsp dried parsley
1/4 to 1/2 tsp kosher salt (start with 1/4)
1/4 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp garlic powder
1 to 2 tbsp vegan butter
Juice of 1 lemon
3 tbsp fresh parsley finely chopped
METHOD ✨:- 
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (on convect/fan setting). Cut potatoes into 3-4 chunks depending on size. Try to have the chunks relatively similar sizes. Place potatoes into large microwave safe bowl, fill with water, mostly covering potatoes. Microwave 10 min, carefully (or skip microwave & boil potato chunks for 6 min, they will still be quite hard). You may need to do two batches depending how large your bowl is. Remove potatoes from water carefully, place into large baking pan. Drizzle liberally with oil (used around 1/4 cup oil) coating all surfaces of potatoes. Sprinkle very generously with salt, pepper to taste. Bake for 25 min, toss carefully, bake another 25 min, toss, check for doneness. You may need to bake another 10-2 min. Once cooked, transfer potatoes to serving bowl. Add wine to baking dish and stir around to collect some potato flavor, then pour into a saucepan. Add onions, spices and oil. Simmer gently until wine reduces by 2/3. Stir in lemon juice, butter, cook another 2 min. Spoon over roasted potatoes. Top with fresh parsley. 🌿🍃🌿🍃
