# Soups
 
- https://runningonrealfood.com/mulligatawny/ super want to try this. Fun fact: mulligatawny was in Seinfeld's soup nazi episode
- https://runningonrealfood.com/spicy-vegan-black-bean-soup/ more complex flavours than my usual black bean soup, hardly takes longer to make, good return on time investment
